Quick Start
===========

My first program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have successfully installed desolver following the :ref:`installation guide here<Installing desolver>` you will be able to test it with the following script.

.. literalinclude:: examples/getting_started.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

Place it into a getting_started.py text file and run it with 

.. code-block:: bash

   python getting_started.py

This script shows the numerical integration of a Hooke's Law spring (harmonic oscillator) for a single cycle.

We recommend the use of Jupyter or ipython to enjoy desolver the most.
